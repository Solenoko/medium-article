  <p>Listing here the top games that will be upcoming at my taste.</p>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Call Of Duty Back Ops 6</h2>
    <p>Although this game it's out already for few weeks, it is a big hype for COD community, finally COD that we wanted to play!</p>
    <h2>Farming Simulator 2025</h2>
    <p>This game just came out few days ago, was a big fan of the game since LS09, didn't change grahpic vise much since FS2022 but still a pretty cool update for the Farming series</p>
    <h2>Grand Theft Auto 6</h2>
    <p>I don't think that there is a single human who isn't excited for this game, prob only monks from Tibet since Wifi there is bad.</p>
    <h2>Kingdom Come Deliverence 2</h2>
    <p>Finally the 2nd sequence of KCD will be out in Febuary 2025, sadly they moved it from 2024 but still hyped to play again as Henry of Skalitz!</p>
